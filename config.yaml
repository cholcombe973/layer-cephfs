      User provided Ceph configuration. Supports a string representation of
      a python dictionary where each top-level key represents a section in
      the ceph.conf template. You may only use sections supported in the
      template.
      WARNING: this is not the recommended way to configure the underlying
      services that this charm installs and is used at the user's own risk.
      This option is mainly provided as a stop-gap for users that either
      want to test the effect of modifying some config or who have found
      a critical bug in the way the charm has configured their services
      and need it fixed immediately. We ask that whenever this is used,
      that the user consider opening a bug on this charm at
      http://bugs.launchpad.net/charms providing an explanation of why the
      config was needed so that we may consider it for inclusion as a
      natively supported config in the the charm.
  auth-supported:
    type: string
    default: cephx
    description: |
      Which authentication flavour to use.
      .
      Valid options are "cephx" and "none".  If "none" is specified,
      keys will still be created and deployed so that it can be
      enabled later.
  source:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Optional configuration to support use of additional sources such as:
        - ppa:myteam/ppa
        - cloud:trusty-proposed/kilo
        - http://my.archive.com/ubuntu main
      The last option should be used in conjunction with the key configuration
      option.
      Note that a minimum ceph version of 0.48.2 is required for use with this
      charm which is NOT provided by the packages in the main Ubuntu archive
      for precise but is provided in the Ubuntu cloud archive.
  key:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Key ID to import to the apt keyring to support use with arbitary source
      configuration from outside of Launchpad archives or PPA's.
  use-syslog:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If set to True, supporting services will log to syslog.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  sysctl:
    type: string
    default: '{ kernel.pid_max : 2097152, vm.max_map_count : 524288,
                kernel.threads-max: 2097152 }'
    description: |
      YAML-formatted associative array of sysctl key/value pairs to be set
      persistently. By default we set pid_max, max_map_count and 
      threads-max to a high value to avoid problems with large numbers (>20)
      of OSDs recovering. very large clusters should set those values even
      higher (e.g. max for kernel.pid_max is 4194303).
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: "juju"
    type: string
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups.
      If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup
